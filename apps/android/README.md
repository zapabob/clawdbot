## Open in Android Studio

- Open the folder `apps/android`.

## Build / Run

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:installDebug
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

## Kotlin Lint + Format

```bash
pnpm android:lint
pnpm android:format
```

Android framework/resource lint (separate pass):

```bash
pnpm android:lint:android
```

Direct Gradle tasks:

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew :app:ktlintCheck :benchmark:ktlintCheck
./gradlew :app:ktlintFormat :benchmark:ktlintFormat
./gradlew :app:lintDebug
```

`gradlew` auto-detects the Android SDK at `~/Library/Android/sdk` (macOS default) if `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` / `ANDROID_HOME` are unset.

## Connect / Pair

1) Start the gateway (on your main machine):

```bash
pnpm openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

2) In the Android app:

- Open the **Connect** tab.
- Use **Setup Code** or **Manual** mode to connect.

3) Approve pairing (on the gateway machine):

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
```

More details: `docs/platforms/android.md`.

  - Android 13+ (`API 33+`): `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`
  - Android 12 and below: `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (required for NSD scanning)
- Foreground service notification (Android 13+): `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
- Camera:
  - `CAMERA` for `camera.snap` and `camera.clip`
